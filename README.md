# LCR-Dixon-Invoice-Processing

Invoicer.py is the main program which includes the functions that read and parse an invoice to extract the Due Date, Invoice Date, Account number, Invoice number, and PO number.

Test.py includes a method to test the capabilities of the functions defined in Invoicer.py. Currently, the test cases use invoices issued by Toyota and Grainger for Bel Brands.

Download the LCR-Dixon-Invoice-Processing file to documents and open the file in an editor. Run test.py and the results for the 6 test case documents should be printed out.
