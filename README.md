# LCR-Dixon-Invoice-Processing

Invoicer.py is the main program which includes the functions that read and parse an invoice to extract the Due Date, Invoice Date, Account number, Invoice number, and PO number.

Test.py includes a method to test the capabilities of the functions defined in Invoicer.py. Currently, the test cases use invoices issued by Toyota and Grainger for Bel Brands. UPDATE 8/24/21: test.py is no longer functional and has been instead integrted into invoicergui.py

Run invoicerGUI.py and browse to the folder which contains the invoices to be processed. Once opened, the individual invoices can be selected and the resulting data wil be displayed on the left side of the screen.

Plans for an excecutable program are in development.
